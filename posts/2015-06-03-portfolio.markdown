On this page I put projects, where I was involved.Some of the projects were just backend web services, some were full stack applications.Anyway, if you are interested in hiring me as a frelance developer, you should learn about this projects:

###Online Booking system for restaurants

To be honest, this was my first project, where I was as a developer.I remember, that I was just a junior java developer with some contradictory skills. The real issue was with my team - actually, nobody could review me, because I didn't have senior developers on the project.So, it was a risky project for me. Anyway, I finished him. Later, I switched to another company, so I don't much about this project for now.

I use:

* Java 1.7
* Spring 3.0
* Hibernate(Can't remember version)
* Twitter bootstrap
* Backbone.js 
* Digital Ocean as a cloud server

###Accountant system.

This was my second project, on which I worked as a backend developer.This was a project, where I started to use unit tests, database migrations, maven multi-module structure, and so on.This also was a project, where I realized why I should use JSR and specifications

I use:

* Spring 4.0
* JPA(Hibernate)
* Maven 3
* Jenkins
* PostgreSQL
* Liquibase


###Simple Save Loyalty System
#####[simplesave.me](http://simplesave.me/)

This was my third project, where I collected most of my knowledge of java.For that time i thought that I have solid knowledge of java.Fortunatelly, I was wrong - I still have things and frameworks to learn.

This is the most succesful application in my freelance career - it rapidly went to production, there is mobile clients and this app is growing - gaining new customers, and so on.

I use:

* Spring 4
* JPA
* MySQL
* Liquibase
* RestAssured integration framework
* jUnit/Mockito for unit tests
* Maven

###Funny Pictures
#####[drawmeme.com](http://drawmeme.com/#/home)

This is funny project, in which I took part.
It's made just for fun and for frameworks investigating.

* Spring 4
* JPA(Hibernate)
* imagemagick 
* Maven 3

The idea of this app is to generate image with thumbnails - for example, if you want to make a joke with about your friend - you can add some text at the top and bottom of picture and send this generated meme to him.
