While planning your travel, don't forget that the type of socket, that u're using - will not always fit with the socket of the country, that you are visiting.
So just in case you will need different types of sockets - I store them in infographic below

I think, there is no need to buy socket adapter before visiting some country, I'm sure that you can buy one just after plane lands in airport.
